# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy to Vercel

Your app is now fully configured for Vercel deployment! Follow these steps:

### 1. Push to GitHub (if not already done)

```bash
# If you haven't pushed to GitHub yet:
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/vib-music-notes.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

**Option A: Via Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect the configuration from `vercel.json`
5. Click "Deploy"!

**Option B: Via Vercel CLI** (recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy (run from project root)
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# ? Set up and deploy "~/git/vib-music-notes"? [Y/n] Y
# ? Which scope do you want to deploy to? [your-username]
# ? Link to existing project? [y/N] N
# ? What's your project's name? vib-music-notes
# ? In which directory is your code located? ./
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

Once deployed, test these features:
- âœ… Upload an audio file (creates a project)
- âœ… Add notes by double-clicking waveform
- âœ… Navigate back to projects - data should persist
- âœ… Refresh browser - data should still be there
- âœ… Keyboard shortcuts work (`Space`, `N`, `V`, `?`)

## Configuration Details

### Files Created for Deployment

- **`vercel.json`** - Vercel-specific configuration
  - SPA routing (redirects all routes to index.html)
  - Proper WASM headers for sql.js
  - Security headers
  
- **`.gitignore`** - Comprehensive ignore rules
  - Excludes build artifacts (`dist/`, `node_modules/`)
  - Environment files
  - Editor/OS specific files

- **`package.json`** - Updated scripts
  - Added `type-check` script
  - Repository and homepage fields
  - Optimized for Vercel auto-detection

### Key Features for Production

1. **Client-Side Only**: No server required, pure static site
2. **IndexedDB Persistence**: All data stored locally in browser
3. **SQLite WASM**: Database runs entirely in browser
4. **Audio Processing**: Web Audio API for waveform generation
5. **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all device sizes
6. **PWA Ready**: Can be extended to Progressive Web App

### Environment Variables

None required! This app runs entirely client-side with no backend dependencies.

### Performance Optimizations

- âœ… **Tree Shaking**: Vite automatically removes unused code
- âœ… **Code Splitting**: Components loaded on-demand
- âœ… **Asset Optimization**: Images and fonts optimized
- âœ… **Gzip Compression**: Vercel automatically compresses assets
- âœ… **CDN Distribution**: Vercel's global CDN for fast loading

### Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails:**

1. **Check build locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

2. **Verify TypeScript:**
   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   ```

3. **Check Vercel logs:**
   - In Vercel dashboard â†’ your project â†’ Functions tab
   - Or via CLI: `vercel logs`

**Common issues:**

- **sql.js WASM issues**: The `vercel.json` configures proper WASM headers
- **Routing issues**: SPA routing is configured for client-side navigation
- **IndexedDB in development**: Works in production, might have issues in localhost (security policies)

### Custom Domain (Optional)

After deployment, you can add a custom domain:

1. In Vercel dashboard â†’ your project â†’ Settings â†’ Domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., `music-notes.yourdomain.com`)
3. Follow Vercel's DNS configuration instructions

## ðŸŽ‰ You're Ready!

Your Vib Music Notes app is now production-ready and optimized for Vercel deployment. The app will work perfectly as a client-side application with full persistence using IndexedDB.

**Live URL**: Your app will be available at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
